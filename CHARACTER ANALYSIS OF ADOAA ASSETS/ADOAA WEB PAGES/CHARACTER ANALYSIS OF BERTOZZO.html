<h1><b><u>CHARACTER ANALYSIS OF BERTOZZO</u></b></h1>

<article class="div-left">
<h2><b><u>ROLE OF THE CHARACTER</u></b></h2>
<p>Inspector Bertozzo plays a crucial role as a foil to the Maniac and as a representative of the police force’s incompetence and hypocrisy. Unlike the other officers, Bertozzo is portrayed as more earnest and frustrated, often serving as the straight man in contrast to the absurdity that surrounds him. His role is significant because, while he is part of the same corrupt system, he is depicted as less directly involved in the anarchist’s death and the subsequent cover-up. Bertozzo’s frustration with both his colleagues and the Maniac’s antics highlights his sense of exasperation with the chaos and dishonesty that plague the investigation. He also provides an additional layer of comedy, often being the unwitting victim of the Maniac’s deceptions and pranks, making him a source of farcical humor. However, despite his exasperation, Bertozzo is still complicit in the systemic issues within the police force, representing the figure who, though aware of the corruption, is powerless—or unwilling—to change it. Through Bertozzo, Dario Fo satirizes not just overt corruption but also the ineffective, bureaucratic figures who become entangled in the chaos of dishonest institutions, further emphasizing the play's critique of authority.</p>

<h2><b><u>CHARACTER MOTIVATION</u></b></h2>
<p>Inspector Bertozzo is motivated by a desire to maintain order and assert his authority within the chaotic environment of the police force, while also distancing himself from the corruption surrounding the anarchist’s death. Unlike his colleagues, who are more deeply implicated in the cover-up, Bertozzo’s frustration stems from a genuine attempt to do his job properly, though he is often thwarted by the absurdity around him. His motivation to expose the truth is overshadowed by his bureaucratic mindset, making him more concerned with maintaining control than with uncovering the deeper corruption. His frustration with both his superiors and the Maniac reflects his desire to be taken seriously and restore some sense of order, yet he remains largely ineffective. He becomes increasingly irritated by the Maniac’s interference, as the Maniac's constant manipulation threatens his authority and exposes his inability to maintain control. At his core, Bertozzo is motivated by self-preservation, wanting to avoid being implicated in the scandal while keeping his position intact. His conflicting motivations—to uphold the law while navigating the corruption of his colleagues—make him a more complex character, caught between integrity and institutional pressure.</p>

<h2><b><u>CHARACTER ACTIONS</u></b></h2>
<p>Inspector Bertozzo’s actions illustrate his struggle between the desire to maintain authority and the absurdity of the situation unfolding around him. Throughout the play, Bertozzo attempts to assert control and navigate the chaos caused by the Maniac's manipulations, which often leads him into increasingly ridiculous scenarios.
