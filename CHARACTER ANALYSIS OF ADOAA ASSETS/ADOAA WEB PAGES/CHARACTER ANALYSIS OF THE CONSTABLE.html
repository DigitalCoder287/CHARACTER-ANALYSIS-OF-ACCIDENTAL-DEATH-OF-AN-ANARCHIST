<h1><b><u>CHARACTER ANALYSIS OF THE CONSTABLE</u></b></h1>

<article class="div-left">
<h2><b><u>ROLE OF THE CHARACTER</u></b></h2>
<p>The Constable plays a relatively minor but significant role in highlighting the pervasive incompetence and blind obedience within the police force. As a subordinate figure, the Constable represents the rank-and-file officers who follow orders without questioning the morality or truth behind them. His character functions as a contrast to the higher-ranking officers, who are directly involved in the cover-up of the anarchist's death. The Constable’s lack of initiative or critical thinking underscores the theme of systemic corruption, as he blindly supports his superiors’ actions, even when they are blatantly unethical. He is portrayed as somewhat dim-witted and easily manipulated by the Maniac, which amplifies the absurdity of the entire situation. Through the Constable, Dario Fo critiques the passive complicity of individuals within corrupt institutions, showing how those who may not be directly responsible for wrongdoing still contribute to it through their unquestioning obedience. His presence serves to reinforce the hierarchical nature of authority, where those at the bottom mindlessly support those at the top, perpetuating a corrupt and unjust system.</p>

<h2><b><u>CHARACTER MOTIVATION</u></b></h2>
<p>The Constable is motivated primarily by a desire to maintain his position within the police force and avoid conflict with his superiors. His actions are driven by a deep-seated need to follow orders and conform to the established hierarchy, reflecting a motivation rooted in self-preservation and a lack of independent thinking. Unlike the higher-ranking officers, who are actively involved in covering up the anarchist's death, the Constable is not a mastermind but rather a passive enabler, motivated by the fear of stepping out of line or challenging authority. His compliance demonstrates a broader theme in the play: the dangers of unquestioning obedience within corrupt institutions. He is not driven by malice or personal gain, but rather by the desire to avoid personal responsibility and the consequences that might come from questioning those in power. As a result, his motivation reflects the moral laziness and complicity that allow systemic corruption to flourish, making him an essential representation of the “everyman” figure who, through inaction, becomes part of the problem.</p>

<h2><b><u>CHARACTER ACTIONS</u></b></h2>
<p>The Constable’s actions reveal his role as a passive and easily manipulated figure within the police force, contributing to the farcical nature of the play. Throughout the narrative, he consistently follows orders without question, acting as a compliant and somewhat dim-witted enforcer of his superiors' will. His actions demonstrate his inability or unwillingness to think critically about the corruption unfolding around him. For instance, he readily accepts the orders from the Inspector and the Superintendent without pausing to consider the ethical implications of the cover-up or the suspicious circumstances surrounding the anarchist’s death. When interacting with the Maniac, the Constable becomes even more of a pawn, frequently falling for the Maniac’s tricks and deceptions without realizing it, which further underscores his lack of agency. His blind adherence to orders, even when they are nonsensical or immoral, highlights his complicity in the corruption, but also paints him as a somewhat tragic figure, too incompetent to act otherwise. Through the Constable’s actions, Dario Fo emphasizes the dangerous absurdity of bureaucratic obedience, where individuals carry out duties without understanding—or caring about—the consequences of their actions, perpetuating institutional wrongdoing through sheer inaction or ignorance.</p>

<h2><b><u>CHARACTER TRAITS</u></b></h2>
<p>The Constable is characterized by his simplicity, obedience, and naivety, traits that make him an easily manipulated figure within the corrupt police force. He is portrayed as dim-witted and lacking in critical thinking, which makes him both a comedic and tragic character. His unquestioning obedience is his defining trait—he follows orders without reflection, showcasing his deep-seated deference to authority. The Constable is also naïve, often failing to grasp the absurdity or illegality of the actions around him, especially when the Maniac begins to manipulate the police officers. His gullibility allows the Maniac to easily deceive him, further amplifying the Constable’s comedic ineptitude. Despite his flaws, the Constable is not malicious; rather, he is a well-meaning but ultimately passive figure, too concerned with maintaining the status quo to act with any real agency. His simplicity makes him a perfect foil to the more cunning characters in the play, and his traits serve to emphasize the theme of blind complicity in institutional corruption. Through the Constable’s traits, Dario Fo illustrates how individuals within systems of power can perpetuate injustice, not out of malice, but through their lack of awareness and blind loyalty.</p>

<h2><b><u>CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS</u></b></h2>
<p>The Constable’s relationships primarily reflect his subordinate position within the police hierarchy and his dependency on authority figures. His interactions with his superiors, particularly the Inspector and the Superintendent, are marked by deference and obedience. He rarely questions their decisions or orders, demonstrating a relationship based on hierarchy rather than mutual respect or understanding. The Constable views them as figures of authority whose commands must be followed without hesitation, even when they are engaged in unethical behavior. His relationship with the Maniac, however, is more complex and reveals his vulnerability. The Maniac manipulates the Constable with ease, exploiting his lack of critical thinking and low self-confidence. Throughout the play, the Constable falls for the Maniac’s impersonations and deceptions, which showcases his gullibility and reinforces the power imbalance in their dynamic. Rather than seeing the Maniac as a threat, the Constable treats him with a mix of confusion and respect due to the Maniac’s assumed authority. This contrast between his relationships with the police officers, whom he unquestioningly obeys, and the Maniac, who outwits him, underscores the Constable’s role as a passive, easily influenced figure within the corrupt system. His relationships illustrate his subservience, highlighting the broader themes of obedience and complicity in the play.</p>

<h2><b><u>CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT</u></b></h2>
<p>The Constable undergoes little direct development, which is intentional and reflective of Dario Fo's critique of institutional figures like him. From the start to the end of the play, the Constable remains a passive, obedient figure, emblematic of those who blindly follow orders within corrupt systems. His lack of growth or change underscores his role as a symbol of unquestioning compliance. While the Maniac’s antics and revelations challenge the higher-ranking officers and force them into moments of panic or self-reflection, the Constable never exhibits such moments of introspection. He consistently follows orders, whether they come from his superiors or the Maniac (when disguised as an authority figure), showing no signs of evolving awareness or rebellion. His static nature amplifies the satire of the play, demonstrating how people in lower positions within a corrupt hierarchy often remain complicit through their lack of personal responsibility. The Constable's development, or lack thereof, serves as a critique of institutionalized apathy and highlights how those at the bottom perpetuate corruption simply by maintaining the status quo.</p>

<h2><b><u>CHARACTER DIALOGUE</u></b></h2>
<p>The Constable’s dialogue reflects his simplicity, obedience, and lack of critical thinking, making him a comedic yet essential part of the play’s satirical critique of institutional corruption. His speech is often characterized by short, straightforward lines that reveal his unquestioning loyalty to his superiors and his inability to grasp the complexities of the situation around him. The Constable’s dialogue is usually reactive—he follows orders, responds to instructions, and rarely initiates conversation, which highlights his role as a passive figure within the hierarchy. When the Maniac manipulates him through impersonation and absurd logic, the Constable’s responses show his confusion and gullibility, often agreeing with the Maniac’s increasingly bizarre claims without realizing the absurdity. His literal and simplistic interpretation of orders, as well as his difficulty in engaging in deeper or critical discussions, further reinforces his lack of independent thought. This, combined with his occasional moments of naïve questioning, adds to the play’s farcical tone. His dialogue serves to underscore his blind loyalty and the ease with which he is controlled by both his superiors and the Maniac, illustrating the broader theme of how those in lower positions within corrupt systems are often oblivious to their complicity.</p>

<h2><b><u>AUTHOR INTENTION</u></b></h2>
<p>Dario Fo uses the Constable to embody the passive, unquestioning obedience that sustains corrupt systems, highlighting the dangers of blind compliance. Through the Constable, Fo’s intention is to critique the "ordinary" people within institutions who, while not directly responsible for corruption, enable it through their lack of critical thinking and moral responsibility. The Constable is not portrayed as malicious or overtly corrupt, but rather as a figure of complacency who unquestioningly follows orders without reflection. By making the Constable a somewhat bumbling and naïve character, Fo draws attention to the absurdity of bureaucratic hierarchies, where even those with minimal understanding or awareness play a role in maintaining systemic corruption. The Constable’s inability to think for himself or challenge his superiors reflects the way in which institutions rely on such individuals to function, perpetuating injustice through passive complicity. Fo’s use of the Constable thus emphasizes the theme that corruption is not only the product of those in power but also of the ordinary individuals who fail to question it, making him a crucial element in the author’s broader satirical critique of societal and institutional failings.</p>
